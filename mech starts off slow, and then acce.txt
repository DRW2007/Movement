mech starts off slow, and then accelerates to a top speed
rocket boosters that raise you up at constant velocity
long distance jump when at full speed
superhero landing ofc
use fuel for rocket boosters for the upwards gravity reduction modifier

platformer where you can build your mech for different specs
speed
acceleration
fuel (high jump)
jump power

what if you had the ability to throw the pilot out? leaves you vulnerable, but maybe access to different weaponry/secret areas?

upgrades
hydromagnetic shock dispersers
- reduces the movement penalty from a rough landing by 50%

superalloy chassis
- lightweight chassis increases acceleration, fuel, and jump power

spikey shoes
- landing on enemies does damage, scaled with your downwards velocity

toroidal magnetic couplings
- increases speed
